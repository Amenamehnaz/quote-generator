# quote-generator
Quote Generator is a beginner-friendly Python project that prints a random inspirational quote to the terminal every time it runs. It's a great way to learn basic file handling, randomization, and user interaction in Python. You can also expand it later by adding more quotes, building a web interface, or fetching quotes from an API.
